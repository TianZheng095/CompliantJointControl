			% Parameter script for a TREE Robotics Orange actuator.
			%
			% The actuator uses a 80:1 transmission ratio and has a stiffness of 6000 Nm/rad.
			% For more details and CAD files of the actuator visit www.treerobotics.eu.
			%
			% Notes::
			%  All inertiae/damping is reflected to link side using n^2
			%  The parameters in this script are partially obtained from experimental identification.
